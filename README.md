# nvim-commenter

This is more of an experiment than a serious plugin. Might fully develop it, if I have the time. 
The goal was to get some auto-commenting to work. I also want to learn Lua. This plugin is the result.

Provides `SingleCommenter`, `MultiCommenter`, `SingleUncommenter` and `MultiUncommenter` commands which perform their actions on the current line or the selection respectively.
